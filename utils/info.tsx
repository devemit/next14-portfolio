         Software Developer, Designer and Creator.
         <br />
         <br />
         I'm a self-taught Software Developer and made the transition from my previous career to
         tech in 2023.
         <br />
         <br />
         I’ve had the pleasure of working alongside some incredible engineers, designers. I’m
         passionate about code standards, ECMAScript, strongly typed interfaces, and reactive
         Javascript frameworks (React is my jam).
      </>
