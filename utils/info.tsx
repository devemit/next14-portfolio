      Software Developer, Designer and Creator.
      <br />
      <br />
      I&apos;m a self-taught Software Developer and made the transition from my previous career to
      tech in 2023.
      <br />
      <br />
      I&apos;ve had the pleasure of working alongside some incredible engineers, designers. I&apos;m
      passionate about code standards, ECMAScript, strongly typed interfaces, and reactive
      Javascript frameworks (React is my jam).
