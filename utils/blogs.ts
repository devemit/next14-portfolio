            'In my latest project, I focused on improving the ECG viewer application by adding advanced visualization and print functionalities. Iâ€™ve implemented a feature to display ECG data across four different charts, each representing distinct time segments. For printing, I created a dynamic system that accurately numbers pages (e.g., "1/2", "2/2") and positions them at the top right corner.',
