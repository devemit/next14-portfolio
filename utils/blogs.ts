    description: `I started building Easy Travel because I want to explore more of the world, but planning trips by myself was chaotic—endless tabs, outdated blogs, and disconnected tools for budgeting, weather, and itineraries. This app brings everything into one place.

I’m using TypeScript with strict mode and custom types to keep the data model tight, and Next.js 15 with server components and streaming so pages load quickly even while AI suggestions render. Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI handle the responsive layout so the planner feels at home on desktop or on my phone.

Prisma and PostgreSQL manage the itinerary data with proper relationships and caching so I can store and revisit past trips. I use Grok AI to plan both weekend getaways and longer trips by asking for itineraries that match my budget, vibe, and time constraints.

Grok helps shortlist destinations, flag visa or safety notes, and returns realistic daily routes that I can edit. The app blends those recommendations with live weather forecasts, cost breakdowns, packing reminders, and calendar exports. Solving that messy planning workflow lets me go from dream board to booked ticket without the spreadsheet fatigue.`,
